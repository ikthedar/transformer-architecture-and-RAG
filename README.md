## 1. Transformer Architecture

### 1.1 Tokenization
- **What**: Breaks input data into smaller units, called tokens.
- **Uses**: Works for text, sounds, or images depending on the model.  
- **Vocabulary**: A dictionary mapping tokens to token IDs.

---

### 1.2 Embeddings
- Converts tokens into high-dimensional vectors that encode their meaning.  
- Stored in a lookup table with fixed vectors for each token.

---

### 1.3 Self-Attention Mechanism
- Captures the context of the entire input sequence simultaneously.  
- **Key Insight**: Unlike RNNs, Transformers process data in parallel.  
- Example: Correcting transcription errors using global context.

---

### 1.4 Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
- Dense neural network layer that follows the self-attention block.  
- **Function**: Provides model capacity for learning and generalization.  
- Example: Predicting "basketball" in "Michael Jordan plays the sport of...".

---

### 1.5 Layers and Depth
- Transformers stack multiple layers to form "deep" networks.  
- Example: GPT-3 uses 96 layers to learn complex patterns.

---

### 1.6 Parallelization and GPUs
- Transformers leverage GPU parallelization for efficient computation.  
- Tensor cores enable fast matrix multiplications across subtasks.

---

## 2. Transformer Output and Prediction

### 2.1 Probability Distribution
- Predicts the next token in a sequence by assigning probabilities to each token.  
- **Autoregressive**: Feeds its own output back into the input.

---

### 2.2 Temperature in Predictions
- Adjusts prediction confidence:  
   - **High temperature**: More diverse outputs.  
   - **Low temperature**: More deterministic outputs.

---

### 2.3 Embeddings and Parameters
- **Input**: Token embeddings (vectors).  
- **Processing**: Attention + MLP layers.  
- **Model Capacity**: Millions to billions of trainable parameters.

---

## 3. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

### 3.1 RAG Overview
- Combines:  
   - Retrieval of information from a vector database.  
   - Language model processing for better responses.

---

### 3.2 LLM Challenges Addressed
- **No Source Knowledge**: LLMs can lack real-time knowledge.  
- **Outdated Information**: Solves the issue without full retraining.

---

### 3.3 RAG Benefits
- Updates only the data source instead of retraining the entire model.  
- Reduces hallucinations and improves reliability.  
- Example: Model responds with "I don't know" if relevant data is unavailable.

---

### 3.4 Real-World Example
**Gaurav Sen's Chatbot for InterviewPrepare**:  
- **Problem**: Poor responses using only OpenAI APIs.  
- **Solution**: Integrated a vector database with RAG to provide better answers.
